# Visual Machine Learning for Intelligent Vehicle (UROP)

This is a project undertaken for my summer research programme. It consists of three components: 

### 1. Driving Behaviour Cloning

This part of the project concerns simulating the driving behaviour for an autonomous vehicle in the Unity developed driving simulation environments.
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture is used to predict the steering angles.


### 2. Semantic Road Segmentation

This part of the project is to segement the KITTI road dataset (captured during drive) into road and non-road pixels.
A Fully Convolutional Nerual Network (FCN) is used to differentiate the pixels in to its actual semantics.

### 3. Lane Detection


## For more details of the three sections, please refer to the README.md file in each sub folder.
